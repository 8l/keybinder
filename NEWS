  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=616401

keybinder v0.1.0
----------------

Released Tuesday,  6 April 2010

* Depend on GTK+ 2.20

* Remove egg* code


keybinder v0.0.9
----------------

Released Tuesday,  6 April 2010

* Replace some egg* code with GTK+ functionality.

* Take great pains to understand "Consumed Modifiers", as in:

  + When pressing *Ctrl+Shift+1* to make *Ctrl+!*, Shift is a consumed
    modifier. So when receiving a binding specification like
    ``<Ctrl>exclam``, we have to dig deep into XKB to find out which
    hardware modifiers are needed to create the bang (!) character.
    With this, it is now possible to bind any composed character.


* Keybindings now work in alternative layouts as well, you just have to
  press the same hardware keys as in the primary layout.  For example a
  keybinding *Ctrl+W*  will still be available on the same physical
  keys after switching to a secondary Greek layout.

* Remove keybinder.is_modifier from the module

* Use -Wall


keybinder v0.0.4
----------------

Released 22 November 2009
