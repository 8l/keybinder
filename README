**keybinder** is a library for registering global keyboard shortcuts.
Keybinder works with GTK-based applications using the X Window System.

The library contains:

* A C library, ``libkeybinder``
* Lua bindings, ``lua-keybinder``
* Python bindings, ``python-keybinder``
* An ``examples`` directory with programs in C, Lua, Python and Vala.


Compile and Installation Notes
------------------------------

Configure using::

    ./configure

Or with configuration options in variables::

    PREFIX=... PYTHON=... LUA=... ./configure


Build using::

    ./do

Install using:

    ./install

To build the python module properly, define ``PYTHON`` and make sure
the program python-config is found by appending ``-config`` to that
place.

To build the lua module properly, define ``LUA`` to the path of the lua
interpreter and ``LUA_CFLAGS`` to so that the header ``lua.h`` is found.
The fallback will only look for the pkg-config package ``lua5.1``.

Set PYTHON=no or LUA=no to disable either option.

The package is configured for building with redo_ which you should use
instead of ``./do`` if available.

History
-------

This library originates in `Tomboy`_ and has been widely reused without
having a separate release. This package has taken the python bindings
from the `Deskbar Applet`_ project, and broken it out to a standalone
project. The library was subsequently rewritten in major parts.

The module is licenced under the GNU General Public License v2 (or at
your option, any later version), see the included file COPYING for
details.
