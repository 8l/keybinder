**keybinder** is a library for registering global key bindings,
for gtk-based applications.

The library contains:

* A C library, ``libkeybinder``
* Python bindings, ``python-keybinder``
* An ``examples`` directory including C, Python and Lua examples,
  including experimental Lua bindings

This library originates in `Tomboy`_ and has been widely reused without
having a separate release. This package has taken the python bindings
from the `Deskbar Applet`_ project, and broken it out to a standalone
project. The library was subsequently reqwritten in major parts.

The module is licenced under the GNU General Public License v2 (or at
your option, any later version), see the included file COPYING for
details.
