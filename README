This is `keybinder` a python module for gtk-based applications
registering global key bindings.

This module originates in [Tomboy][tb] as has been widely reused without
having a separate release. This package has taken the python bindings
for Tomboy's keybinder from the [Deskbar Applet][da] project, and broken
it out to be a standalone module.

The module is licenced under the GNU General Public License v2 (or at
your option, any later version).
