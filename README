**keybinder** is a library for registering global keyboard shortcuts.
Keybinder works with GTK-based applications using the X Window System.

The library contains:

* A C library, ``libkeybinder``
* Lua bindings, ``lua-keybinder``
* Python bindings, ``python-keybinder``
* An ``examples`` directory including C, Python and Lua example
  programs.

If you don't have the neccessary dependencies, and don't want to build 
the python bindings, you have to explicitly disable them using the
``--disable-python`` option with configure.

It is possible you need to tell configure where Lua includes are to
be found using the ``--with-lua-includes=`` option, and how to find the
right library version using the ``--with-lua-suffix=5.1`` option.

This library originates in `Tomboy`_ and has been widely reused without
having a separate release. This package has taken the python bindings
from the `Deskbar Applet`_ project, and broken it out to a standalone
project. The library was subsequently rewritten in major parts.

The module is licenced under the GNU General Public License v2 (or at
your option, any later version), see the included file COPYING for
details.
